### About
This is the second iteration of my personal portfolio. The previous version was built with Bootstrap and Bootstrap templates. This is the place where you can get to know me in a much more interactive way instead of getting to know me through an A4 sheet. I am very happy with the website but it is still in progress. I will keep on adding new features as I master them to make the portfolio even more attractive.
